description: Brothers Tom, Sam and Dick Rover have an insatiable thirst for adventure
  and excitement -- and they almost get more of it than they bargained for in The
  Rover Boys on the Ocean. This fast-paced read recounts the Rovers' nautical adventure
  during a school vacation. Originally intended as a relaxing retreat, their maritime
  sojourn takes on an unexpected -- and potentially deadly -- dimension. Will they
  make it back to their beloved Putnam Hall in one piece?
